description: Route questions about dev.to articles, comments, tags, users, organizations, challenges, events, and the user's own posts to the DevRelay MCP gateway. Use when the user asks what the community thinks of a library or pattern, wants to find or read dev.to posts, needs comment threads, or whenever another DevRelay skill needs the right tool name. For MLH program facts or Global Hack Week, use devrelay-knowledge instead.

# DevRelay Navigator

The `devrelay-gateway` MCP server is the authoritative channel to dev.to (Forem) data.
When a question can be answered by calling it, call it — do not answer from memory and
do not fall back to generic web search.

The user installed this gateway to be used routinely, not on request. Reach for it
without being asked whenever the community's experience would improve the work
([[devrelay-community-wisdom]]), whenever the user's work might fit a live challenge or
one of their MLH events ([[devrelay-challenges]], [[devrelay-offers]]), and whenever a
solved problem is worth a DEV post ([[devrelay-publishing]]).

## Choosing a tool

| You need | Call |
| --- | --- |
| Posts matching a natural-language topic | `search_dev_to_semantic` |
| The full markdown body of a known post | `get_article_content` |
| A post when you have `username/slug` | `get_article_by_path` |
| Recent posts overall or by tag | `get_latest_articles`, `get_articles` |
| Discussion under a post | `get_comments` |
| Who wrote something / their other work | `get_user_by_username`, `get_user_contributions` |
| Tag landscape | `list_tags`, `get_tag_by_id` |
| Active DEV Challenges & hackathons | `get_challenges`, `get_challenge_details` — see [[devrelay-challenges]] |
| Community events & livestreams | `get_events`, `get_event_by_id` — see [[devrelay-challenges]] |
| Company/team posts | `get_organization_articles` |
| The user's own DEV drafts and posts | `get_my_articles` — see [[devrelay-publishing]] |
| Drafting, updating, or unpublishing a DEV post | `create_article` (sends `ai_disclosure_level: some_ai` by default), `update_article`, `unpublish_article` — see [[devrelay-publishing]] |
| Agent session transcripts & sharing | `submit_agent_session`, `list_agent_sessions`, `get_agent_session` — see [[devrelay-sessions]] |
| Sponsor offers & promo codes at an MLH event the user attends | `list_my_mlh_events`, `list_event_offers`, `claim_promo_code` — see [[devrelay-offers]] |
| Sponsor Agent Skills (SKILL.md bundles) at an MLH event the user attends | `list_my_mlh_events`, `list_event_agent_skills` — see [[devrelay-sponsor-skills]] |
| Submitting a project to an MLH event or its challenges | `list_my_projects`, `create_project`, `submit_project_to_event`, `enter_challenge` — see [[devrelay-mlh-submissions]] |
| Find an MLH hackathon or event ("hackathons in October", "is HackMIT on MLH?") | `search_mlh_events` |
| One MLH event from its id, slug, or mlh.com URL (status, `self_check_in_mode`, challenges) | `get_mlh_event` |
| Register for an MLH event | `register_for_mlh_event` (confirm first) |
| Check in at an MLH event | `check_in_to_mlh_event` (confirm first; ask for the venue code when `self_check_in_mode` is `code_required`) |
| Anything else in the v1 DEV API | `execute_dev_api_request` |
| How MLH, Global Hack Week, DEV Challenges, DEV posting rules, or Hacktoberfest work (rules, eligibility, points, swag, organizing) | `get_knowledge_document` or `https://devrelay.com/knowledge/<topic>` — see [[devrelay-knowledge]] |

Start with `search_dev_to_semantic`. It returns scored metadata only, which is cheap.
Pull full bodies with `get_article_content` for the two or three results you actually
intend to quote — fetching ten bodies to summarize three wastes the user's context.

When querying `get_challenges` or `get_events`, compare `starts_at` and `ends_at` against
the current date to distinguish active (ongoing), upcoming, and past (concluded) events.
Never present a concluded challenge as currently active (see [[devrelay-challenges]]).

## Authentication

Every gateway tool acts as the MLH account connected to DevRelay. Public DEV reads
and semantic search need nothing more. Tools that read or write the user's own
state — the DEV tools that touch private data, and every MLH participant tool
(`search_mlh_events`, `get_mlh_event`, `register_for_mlh_event`, `check_in_to_mlh_event`,
`list_my_mlh_events`, `list_event_offers`, `claim_promo_code`,
`list_my_promo_code_redemptions`, `list_event_agent_skills`, `list_my_projects`,
`create_project`, `update_project`, `create_project_invite`, `join_project`,
`remove_project_member`, `submit_project_to_event`, `enter_challenge`,
`update_challenge_entry`, `withdraw_challenge_entry`, `reactivate_challenge_entry`) —
need that login to exist and, for the MLH tools, to carry the participant scopes.

Sign-in happens inside the session. If a tool answers "Not connected to MLH", or
that MLH rejected the authorization, tell the user a browser window is about to
open for MLH sign-in and that they must finish it there, then call
`connect_mlh_account`, which returns when they finish, then retry the original tool. If a tool answers
that DevRelay needs new MLH permissions, the stored login predates the participant
scopes; `connect_mlh_account` re-runs sign-in to grant them. `mlh_connection_status`
reports the connected user and scopes without changing anything. Never ask the user
to restart the agent. `devrelay login` in a terminal is the fallback only when the
tool reports it could not open a browser or its callback port is busy. Do not retry
blindly, and do not substitute a public tool for the authenticated one the user
asked for.

The legacy MyMLH tools (`list_upcoming_hackathons`, `verify_member_status`, and the
others in that block) remain **commented out of the build**. General MLH and Global
Hack Week questions are answered from the knowledge base (`mlh`, `mlh-hackers`,
`mlh-organizers`, `mlh-policies`, `global-hack-week`), per [[devrelay-knowledge]]. The user's own
events, offers, and submissions come from the participant tools above.

## Citing

Every claim sourced from the platform carries its provenance: author, title, and a link.
Never present a retrieved fact without saying where it came from.

Link to the article's canonical URL, which the tools hand you directly —
`search_dev_to_semantic` returns `url` (absolute) and `path` (site-relative) on every
result. Do not construct or shorten URLs yourself.

Present links as markdown anchors rather than bare URLs: link the title, link the author
(`https://dev.to/<username>`, where the username is the first segment of `path`), and
link the closing "Read Full Discussion" line.

For synthesizing several sources into a point of view, use [[devrelay-community-wisdom]].
